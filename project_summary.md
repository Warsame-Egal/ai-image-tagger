✅ Project Summary: Smart Vision – Image Recognition Web App
🧠 What It Does:
User uploads or snaps a photo

The app sends that photo to a machine-learning image recognition API

The API returns objects or labels found in the image (e.g., “Laptop”, “Tree”, “Dog”)

Your app displays the labels with confidence scores

Optionally, it shows extra info/fun facts using OpenAI Codex/GPT (e.g., “Laptops were invented in…”)

(Optional) Users can log in and save their image history

🧱 Final Architecture
Layer Tech
Frontend React + Tailwind + Vite
Backend Node.js + Express + TypeScript
ML API Google Vision API or OpenAI Vision
Extra Info OpenAI Codex or GPT
DB MongoDB (for users/images)
Auth JWT
Hosting Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend/db)

🛠 Key Features
MVP Scope:
✅ Upload image → see detected objects (labels + confidence)

✅ Basic UI with preview and results

✅ Backend processes image → calls ML API

✅ Return and display results to frontend

Optional Enhancements:
🔒 JWT-based user login/register

💾 MongoDB stores upload history + labels

💡 Call OpenAI to show fun facts about detected objects

📈 Analytics tab (e.g., most common objects detected by user)

🧪 External API Setup
🟢 Google Vision API
Use labelDetection() for general object labels

Returns JSON with labels and confidence

🔵 OpenAI API (optional)
Pass each label to gpt-4 or codex with a prompt like:

“Give a short fun fact about [label]”

📝 MongoDB Schema (Optional)
